= Sebastian Lie Hsien Yong - Project Portfolio

== Section Level 1


This project portfolio details my key contributions to Project One Life.

One Life is a desktop medical management application designed by me and my groups mates for a software engineering
module in National University of Singapore (NUS).
It aims to improve the efficiency of administrative processes in medical institutes.
The project was created under the constraint of the fact that the user only interacts with the application through a Command Line Interface (CLI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
