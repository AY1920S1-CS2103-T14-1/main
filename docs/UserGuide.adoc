== Introduction

Teacher’s Notebook is for teachers who prefer to make use of an application to keep track of the deliverables,
tasks and students’ information. It is optimized for teachers who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are a teacher who wants to manage your students and your tasks efficiently, and can type fast, Teacher’s Notebook can get your work done much faster than traditional applications! Jump to Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started! Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest teachersnotebook.jar {repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Teacher’s Notebook.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type in the commands and press enter to execute them. Refer to Section 3: Features for more details on the commands.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== User-Friendly Features

The features here do not necessarily contribute directly to a teacher's everyday job, but improve the usability
of Teacher's Notebook and make using the application a more forgiving, painless and seamless experience. +

==== Autocomplete

The Autocomplete feature allows a user to toggle through suggestions that guess at what command the user wants to type in. +
Upon typing any letters that resemble commands, a popup menu will appear as shown below:

image::autocorrect/autocomplete2.jpg[auto,500,480,pdfwidth=50%,scaledwidth=50%]

The user can then choose the first option of the menu using CTRL, use SHIFT + UP and SHIFT + DOWN to cycle through menu options, +
or use ESC to close the pop window. If the popup menu is closed, no autocomplete features will be available. +

Usage:

`SHIFT + Arrow DOWN` and `SHIFT + Arrow UP` Keys to toggle between autocomplete options +
`CTRL` Key to choose the first autocomplete suggestions +
`ESC` Key to close the autocomplete suggestions +

==== History

The History feature allows a user to toggle through their previously entered commands, +
regardless of whether the user command was successful. As this may clash with autocomplete suggestion toggling, we recommend closing +
autocomplete suggestions before using the History feature. +

Usage:

`Arrow UP and DOWN` Key to toggle through previous commands +

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo/Redo: Undo/Redo

The undo/redo feature allows a user to undo any command, and there is no limit on the number of actions that can be undone or redone.
After the undo/redo command the application will be in the state before/after the action was made. +

States will only be made if there is a modification to the notebook. Hence, commands like `help` and `liststudents` that does not change the internal structure of the notebook will not lead to a saved state. +

Undo will only be executable if there is a previous state saved. Redo will only be executable if there is a previously undone method. +

If a command that changes the state of the notebook is called after an `undo` command, the other states after the current pointer will be erased.
This means that users will not be able to redo any of the previous states, until the user calls another `undo` command again.
This mechanism is similar to how undo/redo works for modern desktop applications.

Undo/redo cannot, however, undo actions made during previous activation of Teacher's Notebook. +
This is to say, once the application is closed, all actions done cannot be undone. +

Usage:

Enter `undo` or `redo` +

// end::undoredo[]

==== Help

Triggers a popup window with a link to the user guide.

Usage:

Enter `help` +

==== Clear

Clears all data from the notebook. If triggered erroneously, the clear command can be undone to reclaim all data.

Usage:

Enter `clear` to clear all data +

==== Exit

Exits the application and stops all teacher's notebook processes. +

Usage:

Enter `exit` +

// end::userfriendly[]


== Additional Features Coming in V2.0

//tag::reminders_for_assignments[]

=== Reminders for Assignments [coming in v2.0]

Assignments can be added to the reminders for the notebook, where users will be alerted when the deadline is up for assignments. +
Once the deadline is over, the assignments will be removed from the reminder panel, but will remain in the assignment list for future reference. +
This will give teachers a clearer idea of what they need to do in the reminder panel beyond just lessons.

//end::reminders_for_assignments[]

//tag::statistics[]

=== Statistics for Assignments [coming in v2.0]

Calculates the statistics for the chosen assignment for each class - Average, Median, 25th / 75th percentile etc. +
This will give teachers a clearer idea of how each class as a whole is doing. +
Format: `getstats ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`

//end::statistics[]
